## Project Description

In this project, we will together create a simple task management application. We'll start with the HTML structure, which will include a form for adding new tasks and a list for displaying them. Then we'll gradually add JavaScript functionality that will allow:

- Adding new tasks
- Marking tasks as completed
- Deleting tasks
- Displaying a list of all tasks

This approach will help you understand how JavaScript interacts with HTML and how we can gradually add functionality to the basic HTML structure.

## HTML Structure

The HTML structure of the application is simple and understandable:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
